                        <p> I always shared my mother's unique passion for cactus and succulent plants. From an early age, I curiously roamed the nursery fascinated by the unique shapes and colors of cactus and succulents. These unique shapes and colors are not the only thing I love, but also how they positively impact our lives. </p>
