                        <p> Agave plants are generally considered perennials, though many types are better described as multi-annuals that take several years to flower before dying—for the most part, agave plants only flower at the end of their lifespan. Their slow-growing nature and interesting appearance make the smaller varieties excellent choices as houseplants. Agaves do very well in dry indoor winter environments, though you must be able to give them plenty of sunlight. <br><br> 
                            Agaves are easily identified by their tapered, thick, and rigid leaves. Most are monocarpic, but will put off many "pups" before the mother plant dies. <br><br> Agave plants are very easy to grow indoors, provided you give them the warmth and sunlight they need. They need very little water and food, and overwatering or overfeeding can actually kill them. They also don’t need repotting very often because they are so slow-growing.
