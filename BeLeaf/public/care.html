                    <h3> Choose the right Succulent </h3>
                    <p>  Not all succulents are suited for indoor growing. Choosing succulents that don't like full sun, but prefer shade or low light will make a big difference in the success of your indoor succulent garden. In general, succulents that have bright colors (such as reds, purples and oranges) don't do well indoors. They require some direct sun and more light than is generally available indoors. </p>

                <div class = "care_card">
                    <div class= "care_card_image watering"> </div>
                    <h3> Watering </h3>
                    <p>  The best way to water succulents is with the “soak and dry” method. Soak the soil completely then let the soil dry out completely before watering again. And make sure the succulents are in a well draining soil in a pot with a drainage hole (more on that in a minute). </p>

                    <div class= "care_card_image soiling">
                    </div>
                    <h3> Soiling </h3>
                    <p> It is highly recommended to use a soil with large particile size, roughly 1/4" or 6mm. Preferably one should use a combination of: </p>
                    <li> Pine Bark Fines </li>
                    <li> Turface (an absorptive rock) </li>
                    <li> Crushed Granite </li>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class = "care_container">
                <div class = "care_card">
                    <div class= "care_card_image light">
                    </div>
                    <h3> Sunlight </h3>
                    <p> Most succulents grow best in a sunny window or patio where they get 3-4 hours of direct sun per day. Remember to protect them from hot afternoon sun when temperatures are 90°F and above. When succulents don't get enough sunlight, they will lose their vibrant color and the new growth will be pale green and elongated. Too much sunlight can burn and scar the plant. </p>

                <div class = "care_card">
                    <div class= "care_card_image glass"> </div>
                    <h3> Avoid Glass Containers </h3>
                    <p>  Glass containers generally aren't a great long term potting solution for succulents. They do not like to be sitting in soggy soil, so a glass jar or terrarium, which does not have anywhere for water to drain out, is not going to make your succulent happy. Another downside to glass containers is lack of breathability. Succulents need good airflow to maintain healthy roots and therefore healthy stem and leaves. </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "care_card">
                    <div class= "care_card_image bugs">
                    </div>
                    <h3> Bugs </h3>
                    <p> A common bug new growers encounter are gnats. Generally you'll only get gnats if your soil stays too wet. Gnats are generally avoidable by using a well draining soil mix and allowing your soil to dry out between watering.

                        Another bug that surfaces all too often is mealy bugs. They are nasty white little guys that hold on to your succulents for dear life. If you do get mealy bugs, you'll want to spray them with rubbing alcohol and pour alcohol over the soil to kill any eggs they may have laid. </p>
